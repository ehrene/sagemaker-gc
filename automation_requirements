I need to build a model in sagemaker and deploy it for inferencing purposes.

The general approach to doing this, as i understand is:
	1. Build the model using jupyter notebook/lab
		a. load training data or connect to training data
		b. build the model (e.g. tensorflow or pytorch CNN for object detection)
		c. train the model 
			1. configure train/test/validation approach
			2. monitor/measure model fit performance (MSE, MAE, cross-entropy, accuracy, etc.)
			3. visualize the performance of the training runs
			4. store the data for reference/analysis
		d. test the model
			1. test the model on test dataset and document the performance
			2. potentially iterate on the testing data using multiple model configurations
		e. publish the model
			1. save model files off into model repository with appropriate attributes (e.g. documentation/owner/creator)
			2.
	2. Deploy the model for utilization by customer
		a. estimate model utilization (calls/hr, compute/call, other)
		b. determine any model updating requirements or process to set workflow for automating update/deployment
		c. containerize the model
		d. create model endpoints and deploy containerized model
			1. security credentialing for auth/auth?
			2. version control is done how?
